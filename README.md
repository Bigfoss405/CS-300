**1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?** <br/>
In this course, I worked on projects to develop software for ABC University.<br/>
In Project One, I created pseudocode to design a program, focusing on how to solve problems using algorithms and data structures.<br/>
In Project Two, I turned that pseudocode into working code, solving basic programming problems and making sure the program ran efficiently​.<br/>
<br/>
**2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.** <br/>
I started by breaking the problem into smaller parts to figure out what the program needed to do.<br/> 
**I then:** <br/>
Wrote pseudocode to outline the steps.<br/>
Chose the right data structures based on the operations needed.<br/>
Data structures are important because they make it easier and faster to organize and process data. For example, I used arrays for storing lists of items and hash maps for quick searches.<br/>
<br/>
**3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?** <br/>
**When I ran into problems, like errors in my code or slow performance:** <br/>
I tested small parts of the program step by step to find where things went wrong.<br/>
I used tools like print statements to check my results.<br/>
If one data structure didn’t work well, I tried another one. For example, I switched from arrays to hash maps to improve speed.<br/>
I also reviewed examples from the course and asked for help when needed.<br/>

**4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?** <br/>
**These projects taught me to:** <br/>
-Start with a plan (pseudocode) before writing code.<br/>
-Think about how the program will handle larger amounts of data.<br/>
-Write code in smaller, manageable parts so it’s easier to test and fix.<br/>

**5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?** <br/>
**I now focus on:** <br/>
-Readability: Using clear variable names and adding comments so others can understand my code.<br/>
-Maintainability: Breaking my program into smaller functions, making it easier to update or fix.<br/>
-Adaptability: Writing code that can handle changes in the future without needing a full rewrite.<br/>
-By practicing these steps, I’ve learned how to write cleaner, more organized code that’s easier to work with.<br/>
